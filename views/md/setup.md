## Setup cemu-no-gyro

-   Install cemuhook and Cemu.  In the Cemu menu click on Options->GamePad motion source->DSU1->By Slot  

-   Tap any button on your controller and it will be auto-detected by cemu-no-gyro  

-   Load the game and adjust the game's motion control settings to your liking.  For example if you just want to use motion controls in the shrines of Zelda BOTW, turn off motion control aiming in the game's settings.

-   Keep this window open while playing and don't minimize it.  Enjoy playing without motion controls!
