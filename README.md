# cemu-no-gyro

Maps the right analog stick's vertical values to gyro motion controls which get sent to Cemu.  Although games like Splatoon have the ability to disable motion controls this app could be useful for games that don't.

### Usage

-   Install Cemu and cemuhook
-   Download [cemu-no-gyro](https://github.com/quinton-ashley/cemu-no-gyro/releases)
-   Run cemu-no-gyro.exe
-   In the Cemu menu click on Options->GamePad motion source->DSU1->By Slot
-   Tap any button on your controller and it will be auto-detected
-   Load the game and enjoy it without motion controls!
